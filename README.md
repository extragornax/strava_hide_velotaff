# strava_hide_velotaff
I got tired of getting spammed in my feed by velotaff / commuter that post their commute without hidding them, so I hide them.
The alternative was to unfollow them but ugh.... once in a while they post stuff I want to see


My current setup on chrome is
- https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/run-javascript/lmilalhkkdhfieeienjbiicclobibjao?pli=1
- add the script, check the "only on strava box" and you are all set
